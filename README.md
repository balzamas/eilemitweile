# Eile mit Weile App

Eile mit Weile App written in Flutter with Flame.

("Hâte-toi lentement", "Chi va piano va sano", "Swiss Ludo", "Swiss Parchisi", "Pachisi")

## Rules
This app uses the common Eile mit Weile rules ("Hâte-toi lentement", "Swiss Ludo", "Swiss Parchisi").

In short:

- You need a 5 to get into the game
- With a six you can move 12 fields (directly shown as 12) and you can throw the dice again
- Three six in a row -> all tokens go gome (except those on ladders and in heaven)
- Two tokens and more on a bench block the field for others passing through. Others can move up on the bench though. Tokens who were on the bench before the blockade started can still move.

## Stage/Notes

Check/create issues on GitHub.

This is my first Flutter project, therefore the code also needs heavy refactoring.
